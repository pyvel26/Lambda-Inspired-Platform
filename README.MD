# Lambda Data Platform
This platform demonstrates Lambda architecture using an 8-container system that combines real-time streaming with scheduled batch processing. Stream data flows through Kafka while batch data is processed directly to PostgreSQL with job tracking and monitoring.
---

## Architecture

## Platform Components (8 Containers)

### Real-time Stream Processing:
- **lambda-producer-ctr**: Generates live transaction data and streams to Kafka
- **kafka**: Message broker for real-time transaction streaming
- **lambda-consumer-ctr**: Consumes Kafka streams and writes to PostgreSQL

### Scheduled Batch Processing:
- **lambda-cron-runner-ctr**: Schedules batch jobs nightly at midnight
- **lambda-csv-batch-ctr**: Generates batch transaction data with job tracking

### Data Management:
- **lambda-postgres-ctr**: PostgreSQL database for transaction storage
- **lambda-pgadmin-ctr**: Database management and monitoring interface
- **lambda-db-setup-ctr**: Schema initialization (runs once, exits)
---

## Data Flow

### Stream Path:
Live Data â†’ lambda-producer-ctr â†’ Kafka â†’ lambda-consumer-ctr â†’ PostgreSQL

### Batch Path:
Nightly Schedule (midnight) â†’ lambda-cron-runner-ctr â†’ lambda-csv-batch-ctr â†’ PostgreSQL

### Management:
lambda-db-setup-ctr â†’ PostgreSQL Schema
pgAdmin â†’ PostgreSQL Monitoring

## ðŸ›¡ Infrastructure Layer Overview

My Host machine: **AMD Ryzen 7 5800H â€” 8 physical cores / 16 logical cores, 16 GB RAM**\
Total project usage: **12.25 logical cores**, **â‰ˆ10.5 GB RAM**

Each container in this setup is capped with CPU and memory limits to avoid overloading the system during streaming and batch processing. These limits were configured to mimic real-world infrastructure behavior, even though this is a self-guided learning project.

> This is an early project built while learning container orchestration and system resource management. The goal was to treat the environment like production from the start â€” even before gaining real-world experience.

#### Resource Allocation
| Container | CPU Limit | Memory Limit | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| kafka | 4.0 | 2g | Message streaming |
| lambda-producer-ctr | 1.0 | 2g | Stream data generation |
| lambda-consumer-ctr | 4.0 | 2g | Stream processing |
| lambda-csv-batch-ctr | 0.25 | 1g | Batch processing |
| lambda-cron-runner-ctr | 0.25 | 1g | Job scheduling |
| lambda-postgres-ctr | 1.0 | 4g | Database storage |
| lambda-pgadmin-ctr | 0.25 | 512m | DB management |
| lambda-db-setup-ctr | 0.25 | 512m | Schema setup |
| **Total** | **~11 cores** | **~13 GB** | **8 containers** |

## Key Features

### Data Processing:
- **Real-time streaming** with Kafka producer/consumer pattern
- **Scheduled batch processing** with CRON job automation
- **Job tracking** with status monitoring (pending â†’ running â†’ completed)
- **Data lineage** with transaction ID preservation from source systems

### Architecture:
- **Lambda pattern** combining stream and batch processing
- **Container orchestration** with Docker Compose
- **Service networking** with isolated container communication
- **Database schema management** with automated setup


## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
git clone https://github.com/pyvel26/Lambda-Inspired-Platform
cd Lambda-Inspired-Platform

# Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your database credentials

# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Check services are running
docker compose ps

# Access pgAdmin to monitor batch-datasource
http://localhost:8080

# (Optional) List Kafka topics
docker compose exec kafka kafka-topics --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

---

## Services

- pgAdmin: localhost:8080 (admin@admin.com / admin)
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
- Kafka: localhost:9092

## Technologies

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Apache Kafka (Confluent Platform)
- Python 3.11
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin

---

## Learning Objectives

Built to practice:

- Event-driven architecture using Kafka
- Producer/Consumer messaging patterns
- Multi-container Docker orchestration
- Real-time streaming systems
- Platform engineering discipline (resource control, networking)
- Microservice separation of concerns

---

## Monitoring

Use pgAdmin to observe transaction data arriving in real-time, validating the full end-to-end data pipeline from producer to database.

## Next Phase: Production Scale

- **Kubernetes**: EKS deployment with Helm charts (*in progress*)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline with multi-environment staging  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana observability stack

*Kubernetes configs available in `/kubernetes` directory*
